# Product Context: Decky Discord Integration

## Problem Solved
Currently, Steam Deck users wanting to use Discord while gaming must switch to Desktop Mode or use a separate device. This disrupts the immersive gaming experience provided by Gaming Mode. This plugin aims to eliminate that friction.

## Target User
Steam Deck owners who actively use Discord for communication (text, voice, video, screen sharing) while gaming and prefer to stay within the native Gaming Mode environment.

## Core User Need
The ability to access and interact with essential Discord features seamlessly through an in-game overlay without interrupting gameplay or switching contexts.

## Desired User Experience
-   **Integrated:** Feels like a native part of the Steam Deck Gaming Mode UI.
-   **Accessible:** Easily toggled on/off via a standard Decky Loader mechanism (e.g., QAM button).
-   **Non-intrusive:** The overlay should be easily dismissible and not obstruct gameplay when hidden.
-   **Functional:** Provides reliable access to core Discord features: viewing servers/channels, text chat, joining/managing voice/video calls, and initiating screen sharing.
-   **Optimized:** Performance should be considered to minimize impact on game performance. UI should be suitable for the Deck's screen size and controller input.

## Key Features (from Project Brief)
-   View Discord servers and channels.
-   Participate in text chat.
-   Join and manage voice and video calls.
-   Screen sharing from the Steam Deck.
