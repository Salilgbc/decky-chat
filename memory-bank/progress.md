# Progress: Decky Discord Integration

## Current Status
-   **Overall:** Project Initiated.
-   **Memory Bank:** Initial documentation structure created.
-   **Code:** No plugin code has been written yet.

## What Works
-   N/A (Project just started)

## What's Left to Build (High-Level)
1.  **Project Setup:** Initialize the Decky Loader plugin project structure.
2.  **Authentication:** Implement Discord OAuth2 flow suitable for Decky.
3.  **Core UI:** Build the basic overlay UI (server list, channel list, chat area).
4.  **Text Chat:** Implement sending and receiving messages via Discord API/Gateway.
5.  **Voice/Video:** Integrate voice/video call joining and basic management.
6.  **Screen Sharing:** Implement screen sharing functionality using SteamOS capabilities.
7.  **Refinement:** Styling, performance optimization, error handling, testing.

## Known Issues / Blockers
-   Need to research the standard Decky plugin initialization process.
-   Need to investigate the best way to handle Discord API/SDK integration (direct, backend service) within the Decky environment.
-   Need to confirm feasibility and implementation details for screen sharing and voice/video on SteamOS via Decky.
-   Need to determine the best approach for handling Discord authentication securely.
