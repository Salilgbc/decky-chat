# Project Brief: Decky Discord Integration

## Core Objective
Develop a Decky Loader plugin for the Steam Deck that integrates key Discord functionalities (text chat, voice/video calls, screen sharing) directly into the Gaming Mode UI via an in-game overlay.

## Inspiration
Inspired by the concept of seamless communication features potentially available on future consoles like the "Nintendo Switch 2," aiming to provide a similar integrated experience on the Steam Deck.

## Development Approach
Utilize AI-assisted coding (Cursor) to build the plugin, focusing on:
1.  Setting up the Decky Loader plugin structure.
2.  Integrating Discord API/SDK functionalities.
3.  Designing and implementing the overlay UI.
4.  Testing and refinement.

## Goal
Create a seamless, optimized Discord communication tool specifically for the Steam Deck gaming environment, allowing users to interact with Discord without leaving their games.
